**Spotify Music Analysis** is a data-driven project that leverages regression models, principal component analysis, and statistical tests to uncover insights into what makes a song popular and how genres differ based on audio features.
By analyzing a dataset of over 52,000 songs, Spotify Music Analysis examines key audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo, which significantly contribute to a songâ€™s popularity. Using community detection algorithms and audio feature clustering, the project identifies genre-specific characteristics, making it possible to classify music by genre.

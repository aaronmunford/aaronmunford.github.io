**Spotify Music Analytics** is a data-driven project that leverages regression models, principal component analysis, and statistical tests to uncover insights into what makes a song popular and how genres differ based on audio features.
By analyzing a dataset of over 52,000 songs, **Spotify Music Analytics** examines key audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo, which significantly contribute to a songâ€™s popularity. Using community detection algorithms and audio feature clustering, the project identifies genre-specific characteristics, making it possible to classify music by genre.
Powered by data preprocessing and machine learning techniques, this project provides a visual and statistical breakdown of what defines music popularity and genre. It demonstrates the use of dimensionality reduction to visualize audio feature patterns and regression analysis to predict popularity.

My name is Aaron. I'm a junior at [New York University](https://cds.nyu.edu/) pursuing a joint degree in Data Science & Computer Science. I am currently interning at the [Institute For Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/) in Princeton, NJ.  

I'm interested in algorithmic trading, machine learning, and AI algorithms, with a specific focus on financial asset pricing and risk modeling. Additionally, I have an interest in the emerging fields of quantum computing and quantum cryptography. 

In my free time, I enjoy wrestling, skateboarding, and film photography.

My name is Aaron. I'm a junior at [New York University](https://cds.nyu.edu/) pursuing a joint degree in Data Science & Computer Science.  I currently work as a Data Science Intern at the real estate investment firm [Neue Urban](https://www.neueurban.com/), where I explore and implement data-driven solutions to support investment strategies, leveraging insights from datasets like tax liens and permit issues.

I interned as an Information Technology Intern at The [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/), where I provided technical support to scholars and researchers. I assisted with everything from network configurations to device management, adapting quickly to support a wide range of technical needs in an academic setting.

I'm interested in algorithmic trading and the development of machine learning and AI-driven models for financial asset pricing and risk management. Additionally, I have an interest in the emerging fields of quantum computing and quantum cryptography. 

In my free time, I enjoy wrestling, skateboarding, and film photography.
